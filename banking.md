GRI Report 2023
The GRI Report 2023 has been prepared on the basis of the internationally recognised standard for sustainability reporting, namely the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and in accordance with the GRI Standards 2021.
It provides stakeholders, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating agencies and socially responsible investors, with a comprehensive overview of the Council of Europe Development Bank’s (Central European Bank’s) approach to environmental, social and governance issues. Therefore, this report does not only present the topics that are most material to the Central European Bank, but provides insights into a wider range of issues. Topics that have been identified as material to the Bank are marked with “material topic” (see also GRI 3). It should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s annual Sustainability Report.
This 2023 edition of the GRI Report is now also reporting on new items such as Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, Supplier Social Assessment, and Customer Privacy.

2-4 Restatements of information
SFor Item 403-10, work-related ill health, the report now discloses a ‘short-term absenteeism’ rate and provides clear guidance on what is included in it. Based on this, figures were adjusted and the former reporting on ‘absenteeism rate’ was discontinued. Compared to the previous ‘absenteeism rate’ the new ‘short term absenteeism rate’ no longer takes into account parental leave, which is reported on under Item 401-3. Sick children leave is also not included in the short-term absenteeism rate. When reworking the disclosures, two errors on ‘long-term illness’ for 2019 (from 4% down to 0.9%) and 2020 (from 0.9% to 1.3%) also have been corrected.
For Item 300 (corporate), the greenhouse gases (GHG) reporting standard has been switched to the internationally recognised GHG Protocol, from the previously used BEGES1 widely applied in France. In order to allow for comparability, the 2023 figures using both the GHG Protocol and BEGES are displayed in the table of the Item 305-5.
